# COVID-DETECTION

A deep learning-based approach for detecting COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using the ResNet-9 architecture.

## Overview

This project aims to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model capable of classifying chest X-ray images into COVID-19 positive or negative categories. Leveraging the ResNet-9 architecture, the model is trained on labeled datasets to assist in the rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 cases.

## ResNet-9 Architecture

The model utilizes the ResNet-9 architecture, a simplified version of the original ResNet designed for efficiency and performance on smaller datasets. ResNet-9 comprises:

- Eight convolutional layers, each followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation.
- Two residual connections: one from Conv1 to Conv3 and another from Conv5 to Conv7.
- Four max-pooling layers to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
- A final dense (fully connected) layer for classification.

This architecture balances depth and computational efficiency, making it suitable for medical image classification tasks like COVID-19 detection. citeturn0search2
